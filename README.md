### Hello fellow human :moyai:!

My name is Tiago Tannus and I live in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil. I recently attained my master's degree in Computer Science and now I am exhilarated to start programming hard again and contributing to as many open source projects as I can!

I really love programming and 
- :eyes: Iâ€™m currently looking for Open Source projects to contribute! :eyes:

I have a really strong background in C/C++ and Python, so I want to keep improving on those languages. Also:
- :construction: I want to strengthen my coding skills with Go and Java.
- ðŸŒ± I want to learn new languages like Javascript, Clojure, and others!
- ðŸŒ± I also really want to get in touch wih new technologies!
